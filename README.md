# Hey there! 👋

I'm **Ocid**, a student and aspiring developer.

I'm currently exploring the world of programming — learning things step by step and building whatever small ideas come to mind.  
If something sparks my curiosity, I’ll try it, break it, fix it, and learn from it along the way.

Right now, I'm learning the basics of **web development** and a bit of **general programming**.  
I experiment with front-end, back-end, and small apps to slowly sharpen my skills.

## 🔧 What I'm Learning
- **Web Basics:** HTML, CSS, PHP  
- **Frameworks:** Laravel (beginner level)  
- **Languages:** Python, Dart (still exploring both)  
- **Tools:** VS Code, Git & GitHub, XAMPP  

I don’t have many public projects yet, but I’m working on improving and preparing more things to share in the future.

## 🧩 Fun Facts
- I'm still learning everything from the ground up  
- I enjoy experimenting even when I don't fully understand things yet  
- I like building simple stuff and watching it grow  
- I'm excited to develop my own style as a programmer

# Hey there! 👋

I'm **Ocid**, a student and aspiring developer.

I'm currently exploring the world of programming, learning things step by step and building whatever small ideas come to mind.  

If something sparks my curiosity, I’ll try it, break it, fix it, and learn from it along the way.

I'm currently learning the fundamentals of web development and general programming. I work with HTML, CSS, PHP, and beginner-level Laravel while also exploring Python and Dart. Most of my practice happens in VS Code with GitHub and Laragon as my main tools.

I don’t have many public projects yet, but I’m working on improving and preparing more things to share in the future.

*Fun Facts 🫠*
- I'm still learning everything from the ground up  
- I enjoy experimenting even when I don't fully understand things yet  
- I like building simple stuff and watching it grow  
- I'm excited to develop my own style as a programmer

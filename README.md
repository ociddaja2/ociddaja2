# Hey there! 👋

I'm **Ocid**, a student and aspiring developer.

I'm currently exploring the world of programming, learning things step by step and building whatever small ideas come to mind.  

If something sparks my curiosity, I’ll try it, break it, fix it, and learn from it along the way.

I'm currently learning the fundamentals of web development and general programming - Mostly Working on frontend.

I work with HTML, CSS, PHP, and beginner-level Laravel while also exploring Python and Dart. I also Use figma for UI design.

I don’t have any public projects yet, but I’m working on improving and preparing more things to share in the future.
